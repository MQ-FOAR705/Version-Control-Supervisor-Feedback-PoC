\section{Introduction}

This document is my new PoC. My plan is to create a workflow which allows me to receive supervisor feedback in a version controlled location, implement said feedback, and then send a report to my supervisor demonstrating that I have implemented their feedback.

\section{Scoping I}

\subsection{A Day in the Life: Feedback from my supervisor on the written component of my thesis}

I need to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have the meeting with my supervisor and record their feedback on my progress.
    \item Make sure I record important actionable feedback in such a way that it is easily understood by myself and them at a later date.
    \item Save the feedback in a version controlled format which I will not lose even if my computer crashes.
    \item Implement their feedback and record it precisely so that I can demonstrate that I have met their demands/suggestions.
    \item Send the implemented actions to my supervisor in an easy to use format for them. (Probably .txt, .docx, or .pdf)
    \item Just in case there is a contradiction between their initial feedback and my appropriate implementation of said feedback, I will have a copy of what they have suggested ready to hand.
    \item Just in case they wish to see precisely what I have changed, I will have a specific 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textit {Pains} and pain relievers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Pain 1: Manually searching through my document(s) to find the specific alteration(s) I have made.} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Reliever: Having a version controlled system in place which enables me to have a history of my alterations as well as an easy way to compare older versions of what I have written to compare with the updated text based on supervisor feedback. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Pain 2: Demonstrating precisely why my alteration is better than the previous version.} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Reliever 1: A set of themed repositories and folders which enable me to search for my feedback based alterations based on: Date of feedback, time and date feedback was implemented, section of thesis, page number.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Reliever 1.1: Being able to compare the current version of a section of text with its older versions. I would then send the relevant versions to my supervisor so they can see the precise alterations I made and see how the alterations satisfy their feedback.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textit {Gains} and gain creators}

\section{Scoping II: Computational Analysis}

\subsection{Instructions}
Using elements of ‘computational thinking’, consider the pains, gains, and solutions you identified during BA. Translate them into a form that can (at least in part) be addressed by computers. To do so, consider these steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decomposition:Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts
    \item Pattern Recognition:Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data.
    \item Algorithm Design:Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems
\end{itemize}
First (and most important), decompose the activities that involve ‘pains’, opportunities for ‘gains’, and any solutions you proposed into small parts and/or discrete steps. Next (if possible), identify patterns in the problems you are trying to solve or the solutions you are proposing. Finally, revise the solutions you developed during Business Analysis to produce a step-by-step guide describing what you want to accomplish.

\subsection{Goal}

I am focusing specifically on one aspect of my research process, the sifting through multiple documents for the purpose of finding key terms and ideas and then organizing them into a unified narrative. The single solvable problem I am addressing from Scoping 1 is the process of gathering and then sifting through multiple documents with ease. I want to make the computer do as many of the mechanical, computable tasks as possible.

\subsection{Decomposition}

The process of finding and organising relevant documents goes as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pattern Recognition}

The patterns I am going to focus on are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Design}

The algorithm is made up of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item

\end{itemize}


\section{Elaboration I}

\subsection{Instructions}

Using the step-by-step breakdown of your problems / solutions developed last week, identify technologies (programming languages, software libraries, APIs (Application programming interfaces, the means by which one program talks to another program) and other components of a modern data collection or processing workflow) that could accomplish each step. You may want to specify more than one possible technology.

\subsection{Task Outline}

\noindent
In Scoping I identified two patterns I wish to make easier. There were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding specific words and sentences within and across different papers in an efficient manner
    \item Collecting and organizing papers into a single bibliographic database in such a way that I can search for papers based on a theme.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
Depending on the software I can find, I may modify the second bullet point to make it a simpler goal for my PoC. I will also include a referencing goal as a part of my PoC.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find software which will serve as a reference database and which will do the referencing work for me 
\end{itemize}


\noindent
I notice that I did not make the Algorithm part of Scoping II detailed enough. It seems I misunderstood the difference between it and the Decomposition section. In the Elaboration process section I rectify this mistake.


\subsection{Potential Software to solve my problems}

\subsubsection{OverLeaf}

Document writing with more control over the formatting etc. compared to Word or Google Documents. Also enables version control in a seamless way.

\subsubsection{GitHub}

This will be where I have the online version controlled repository for the feedback.

\subsubsection{Pandoc}

Pandoc will allow me to convert from TeX to docx.


\subsection{Elaboration process}

The steps I need to take to test the software listed above are as follows:

    \item

\subsection{7 NOV}

1:30 PM
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intention: Figure out how to convert TeX document to docx.
    \item Action: Spoke with Brian in a consultation. He send me this article to read: https://medium.com/@zhelin\-chen91/how-to-convert-from-latex-to-ms-word-with-pandoc-f2045a762293
    \item Outcome: It seems that Pandoc is a very good candidate software for converting TeX into docx. Pandoc is both free and open source, two positives for a piece of software I am intending on using in a workflow for multiple users.
\end{itemize}

1:46 PM
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intention: Download Pandoc for my Macbook
    \item Action: Went to: https://pandoc.org/installing.html to find the installer for Mac. Clicked on the button at the top of the page `Download the latest installer for macOS.' Followed instructions and installed Pandoc. 
    \item Outcome: It seems that I need to have either an older version of Pandoc, or I need to install a newer macOS. On the Homebrew Formulae website it states in the `bottle' section `mojave, high\textunderscore sierra, sierra'. So it seems the current version of Pandoc is only compatible with those three macOS versions.
    \item Solution: I will look for an older version of Pandoc compatible with OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6. If I cannot find a compatible version of Pandoc I may have to update my OS. I have found a number of programs do not run on my OS. Considering my OS is a number of years old I am not surprised.
\end{itemize}

2:05 PM

\begin{itemize}
    \item Intention: Find a version of Pandoc which works on my Macbook
    \item Action: Went to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48430440/install-older-version-of-pandoc-2-using-homebrew from a google search for compatible versions of Pandoc with macOS El Capitan 10.11.6.
    \item Outcome: The answer provided three solutions. One option was to use old formulas. The second was to use old bottles. The third was to ``Build your own retro-formula". I decided to try the second option.
    \item Following the instructions I went to this website: https://bintray.com/homebrew/bottles/pandoc/1.16.0.\-2\#files which had this file https://bintray.com/homebrew/bottles/download\textunderscore  file?file\textunderscore path=pandoc-1.16.0\-.2.el\textunderscore capitan.bottle.tar.gz
    \item Solution: I will look for an older version of Pandoc compatible with OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6. If I cannot find a compatible version of Pandoc I may have to update my OS. I have found a number of programs do not run on my OS. Considering my OS is a number of years old I am not surprised.
