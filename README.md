# Version-Control-Supervisor-Feedback-PoC
This is my updated PoC document.

# What's this repository about?
This is a repository I created for a workflow which streamlines a few steps of work for researchers in philosophy using Docx files to send and recieve feedback from peers and supervisors. This workflow is applicable for anyone who relies on primarily text based research and uses Microsoft word in their research process.

This is a repository where I am testing my PoC for version controlling comments and feedback from my supervisor, and
where I track the history of changes made based on the comments and feedback.
