# Version-Control-Supervisor-Feedback-PoC
This is my updated PoC document.

# What's this repository about?
This is a repository I created for a workflow which streamlines a few steps of work for researchers in philosophy. This workflow is also applicable for anyone who relies on primarily text based research.

This is a repository where I am testing my PoC for version controlling comments and feedback from my supervisor, and
where I track the history of changes made based on the comments and feedback.

# What's in this repository

In this repository you will find:

- A list of need to know and useful to know command line scripts for Shell to communicate with Git, Pandoc, and GitHub.
- A few examples of what version controlling your work looks like.
- A few examples of what it looks like to version control comments in Docx files which have been converted to txt or md.
