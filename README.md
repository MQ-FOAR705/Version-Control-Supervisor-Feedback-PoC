# Version-Control-Supervisor-Feedback-PoC
This is my updated PoC document.

# Why should you care about this repository?

This is a place for those who are looking for ways to work with docx files but may be frustrated with the ability to version control on sites such as GitHub.

I have begun to develop a process which will enable a person to convert from Docx to a non-binary format and version control while retaining important information such as Word comments in the conversion.

The main problem I identified is that when converting from Docx to txt directly from Word itself the comments get lost in translation. Using a program called Pandoc I found a solution to this problem. Using the macOS terminal on my laptop I was then able to version control locally on my laptop and on GitHub.

# What's this repository about?
This is a repository I created for a workflow which streamlines a few steps of work for researchers in philosophy using Docx files to send and recieve feedback from peers and supervisors. This workflow is applicable for anyone who relies on primarily text based research and uses Microsoft word in their research process.

This is a repository where I am testing my PoC for version controlling comments and feedback from my supervisor, and
where I track the history of changes made based on the comments and feedback.
